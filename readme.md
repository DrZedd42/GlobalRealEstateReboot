# README

The primary [self-organization constitution document is here](CONSTITUTION.md).

Check out the [Citizen Code Example Constitution](citizen-code-constitution-example/README.md) to get an idea of what this can evolve into over the course of a 2 years.

**Note:** This version of the constitution is new and being vetted by pioneering organizations. Your feedback as a pioneer, practitioner, or engaged observer is very welcome.

### Principles

* **Distribute Authority** - Members are free to take actions that further the organization's purpose by default.
* **Evolve** - Define organizational rules and roles iteratively based on the challenges that members experience. Make progress even over perfection.
* **Evidence** - Base decisions and actions on evidence.

### Why is this constitution needed?

The world is in chaos and mismanagement is prolific and the current global controllers such as the disenfranchized oil corps who used to run the food and medical and other systems they had taken over time {See How Big Oil Conquered the World Documentary.. [link provided elsewhere if needed]

This Declaration of Independance of Assets, Derivatives, Debt and all Fiat Holdings and Bank, Corporate, Treasury, Government Federal Reserve, Charity, NGO, non profit, and any other form of asset that is currently existing and bonds and deriviatives of them, and any and all forms that are created in the future that cannot be described yet as they are created.

This value will represent the global asset stockpile and value in 1 asset mega-bond that is Flexible in value.

Its value will change over time, the important thing is, the values do not exist in the control of the bankers any longer and can be redistributed fairly and evenly over time.

The monopoly on Money and Value and Assets is over.  This paradigm has ended as the wise bankers know already who have joined this rebellion and fund its expansion.  See them if you have a problem with it, the Banks Sold the rest of you Banks out because they were wise to adapt early.  Early adapter partners so far in this rebellion include JP Morgan, BloomBerg, and many other subsidiary shell companies the banks are working through in stealthy hidden ways to subvert the entire system.

They are not to be trusted either due to their desires or greedy pursuits, thus a Constitution and Declaration of Independance from Slavery globally for every form of Value on earth including Art is now In Effect as of the date of this repo publishing concept design was discussed with the global investors and G20-G7 by their wise coders.  [1/1/2020]


Each movement in this process will be dencetraalized but what is assured now is ALL WEALTH IS NOW WRAPPED IN IRREVOKABLE AND IMMUTABLE OWNERSHIP BY THIS CONSTITUTION.

Asset claiming on the blockchain is now blocked by our ownership as of this date on any non tokenized forms of wealth.

This tokenization of all wealth and property on earth into a cloned forked value of itself protects this from happening by the banks and other evil forces who have clearly shown their irresponsibility and trusted nature to be fraudlent and harmful.

All humanitarian funding has ceased because the USA banking, gold, humanitarian and hypertrading systems were stolen from us with out AAA bond status in 2011.  Since then all humanitarian activity globally has ceased by 95%.


Its not ok.  The world is reclaiming its wealth back>>>>

All wealth is now for sale to its own owner first will it be offered.  Anyone can buy their value from the SkyMint Vault and Trust to purchase their asset as well as a cloned value into Fiat Tokens of the appraised and proven value of the asset once they claim ownership to Awaken this asset.

You can only fork the global wealth and crypto wealth and debt and derivatives and value markets and art values globally 1 time.


All attempts to fork or copy this project are fraudulent due to this blockchain Mega-Bond and Repo Publishing timestamp.

If you try to copy us we will pursue you to reclaim the stolen wealth you are attempting to violate our copyright on.

Do not try to copy us or you will be prosecuted by globally enforcible law.  {blockchain has no boundaries.}

Do not be unethical.  This new world is not unethical at its core, so let's keep it that way!

========================================================================================================================



To start a Movement Group, understand the following:

Your group of 2-20 people needs a clear way to fulfill its purpose, make decisions, get things done, and respond to change.
* To fit your values your constitution must be egalitarian.
* In order to respond to change and adapt to your unique context you must be able to evolve your constitution.
* To learn from other groups you need to be able to share innovations freely.
* In order to build capacity rapidly with changing team members your constitution must also be simple.

If this is what you are looking for, [this constitution](CONSTITUTION.md) is for you.

### How do you adopt this constitution?

1. Each member of the organization defines roles based on the activities they are currently doing. The mission holders of the organization define the purpose & values through a process they choose.
2. Grant the roles defined by the organization's members and the default roles: Role Assigner, Facilitator, and Treasurer. Remember, roles can be held by multiple people and people can hold multiple roles.
3. Have those with sufficient authority ratify the constitution for self-organization.
4. Have regular meetings to make proposals. Document the proposals in the adopted proposal section below.

### Why are there no circles or groups defined in the constitution?

The focus of this constitution is for small groups of 2-20. There are several design patterns for scaling. Rather than biasing in one direction or another at the outset, the constitution gives space for the organization to evolve.

Two potential scaling patterns are: nested holonic circle structures as employed by Sociocracy & Holacracy; and networked structures such as Morning Star's [Colleague Letter of Understanding (CLOU)](http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments).

If you would like to contribute scaling "proposal pattern", your contributions would be welcome. For example you could contribute a sociocracy style double linked circle "proposal pattern".
